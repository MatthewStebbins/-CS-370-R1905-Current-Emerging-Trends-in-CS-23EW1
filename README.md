**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

 - For this project I was given TreasureMaze.py which handled the enviroment including the Maze. The second was GameExperience.py which stores the experience the agent gained. For this project I added the deep Q-lreaning.
  
**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**

 - Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, plays a pivotal role in computer science by enabling computers to automatically learn and make decisions from data, mimicking aspects of human intelligence. It forms the foundation for a wide range of applications, from natural language processing and image recognition, like we learned with reading handwritten letters at the begain of this course, to autonomous vehicles and recommendation systems, significantly advancing the capabilities of computer science in solving complex, data-driven problems.
  
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

 - Computer scientists research, design, and develop computer technologies, playing a crucial role in driving innovation, solving complex problems, and advancing multiple aspects of modern life.
  
**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

 - As a computer scientist, you approach a problem by first understanding its requirements and constraints, then breaking it down into smaller, manageable subproblems, and finally devising algorithms, writing code, and testing solutions while considering efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.
  
**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

 - My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization encompass ensuring transparency, data privacy, fairness, security, adherence to ethical standards, ethical decision-making, user feedback incorporation, and accountability to society in the development and deployment of machine learning systems.
